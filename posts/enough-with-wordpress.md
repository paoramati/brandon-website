I'm sick of being excited to build a website quickly with WordPress, only to get immediately discouraged when trying to customise a theme. And that's just the start. I know for a fact that:

- Deployment is going to suck
- It will be slow
- I can only work on it from 1 computer (version control is not really possible)
- It's not going to be "fun" to develop

The only real advantage, at least when just I'm using it, is it might be easier for other people to use the site and create content.

But that can't be true. It **can't** be the case that WordPress somehow corners that feature. So my main motivation for trying NextJS - apart from aliviating those points listed - is to test whether "content" can be easily generated for a site by non-developers. I'm also going to have to tackle e-Commerce and other server-side issues. But if I can tackle non-dev content generation, then this could be revolutionary.

Another thing to keep in mind is can this non-dev content be generated with a friendly editor? If a non-dev can use a WYSIWYG editor, or something similar to divi, and then spit out markdown, then we really could get around ever having to use WordPress again.

I **never** want to use WordPress again* 

*(this isn't actually a dig at WordPress, or people who use it, it's just absolutely not for me)
