This is my first real website!

- I've got a domain with my name!

- The website is running and publicly available - with https! - and not running on some skivvy "free" hosting service that feels like it might give me crabs!

It's taken a while for me to embrace the web. I've been a professional software developer for 3 years now, and spend a fair amount of time working with the web. But now I **really** want to learn the web.

Oh, I also want to make other people websites, but I hate WordPress. So this is a place where I'm going to learn how to make websites in a way that's: fun, easy, scalable, not-WordPress.

 So hopefully my forays will help other people who had/have similar problems.
